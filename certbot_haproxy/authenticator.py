"""HAProxy Authenticator.

The HAProxy Authenticator is an extension of the "standalone" authenticator
that is part of certbot. It limits its functionality to only support the
`http-01` challenge because `tls-sni-01` checks the challenge by connecting to
port 443.  We can't proxy requests to certbot because we can't see the
requested uri until the request is decrypted, and we can't do decryption in
HAProxy because `tls-sni-01` expects to do a TLS handshake.

This authenticator creates its own ephemeral TCP listener on the necessary port
in order to respond to incoming `http-01` challenges from the certificate
authority. You need to forward port requests for `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`
on port 80 to the configured value for `haproxy-http-01-port` (default:8000).
This can be achieved by adding this example to your haproxy configuration
file::

    default_backend nodes

    acl is_certbot path_beg -i /.well-known/acme-challenge
    use_backend certbot if is_certbot

    backend certbot
        log global
        mode http
        server certbot 127.0.0.1:8000

    backend nodes
        log global
        mode http
        option tcplog
        balance roundrobin
        option forwardfor
        option http-server-close
        option httpclose
        http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Port %[dst_port]
        http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
        option httpchk HEAD / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost:localhost
        server node1 127.0.0.1:8080 check
        server node2 127.0.0.1:8080 check
        server node3 127.0.0.1:8080 check
        server node4 127.0.0.1:8080 check
